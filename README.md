Plan A A+ A++:
A--simplest,just drag a whale to interect with sth
A+---operating submarine to attrack cute whales
A++---multiple player mode,each player can become a whale

I started from PLAN A
【noumenon】
1-make a whale with mouseX&Y
2-make a simply interective cyber whale
(they will follow u accroding to the mouseX&Y)
【Different device linkage/network connection】
1-Can be played on the phone(touch the screen)
2-multiple players attract multiple whales at the same time(optional/potintial extension)

I start to test the phone interection directly from this[project prototype reference https://editor.p5js.org/ltomlinson/sketches/3yY82TBxQ]

The key to operate the game both in computer&mobile device is to find a paramater suitable for phone that similar to mouseX&Y
obviously its not a good idea to write[mouseY/mouseX );],because it seems my phone dont know what mouse.x/y means

so i give a paramater called"TARGET"<img width="248" height="49" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7126b6e0-c2be-4f6d-a94d-a0ab30a76bb1" />
 transfered TO mouse X&Y
↓this is the first time i try to make this,so there s a lot of chaos during i creat this thing,my mobile phone showed nothing for 2 hours,i have to create test file to check the problem
(actually i didnt managed to find out whats going on,probably its my method to open the browser was unreasonable(?))
